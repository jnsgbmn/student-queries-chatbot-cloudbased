WE researchers have developed a chat bot that can integrate to a website and would help students inquire about the problems that they would encounter in using a website. Docker is extremely efficient by using a method called “container”, any application stored here is ready to be used. However, the API of the chat-bot needs to be changed to user slack API. For future researchers, they should add a way to improve the chat bot to a more "Human-like" interactions and add a personalize recommendations to the users.
